# The script analyze spectra for given lists of elements with their lines.

# Spectra files must be placed under /analyze_spec/spectra_files/ folder.

# Elements (with their lines) that we want to use are in the files that we place under /analyze_spec/line_list_files/ folder.

# Elements (with their lines) must be in specific format inside the files (see "header" of line list files in PARAMETERS.py)

# We can analyze one or more spectra on the same plot and we can have multiple plots.

# We can use one or more files (that contain elements with their lines) for analyzing the spectrum/spectra (of same plot).

# We can plot dashed lines for specified elements and their lines.

# Everything should be carefuly specified in the PARAMETERS.py file before using analyze_spec.py script.
